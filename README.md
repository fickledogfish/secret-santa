# Secret Santa

A simple secret santa project I made for a code interview.

## Running

If you just want to run things locally for debugging or testing, use the
`run_test_env.sh` script; it assumes you have docker with a postgres image and
npm installed, but it sets everything up according to your `.env` file. If you
don't want to use it, there's always the usual

```Shell
npm i && npm run start
```
